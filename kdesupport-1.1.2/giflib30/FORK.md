#FORK

This is quite an old version of GIFLIB. It's quite possible that we can update and simply compile the newer GIFLIB: http://giflib.sourceforge.net/

However, it does compile on a modern system and seems to function well. The largest concern is long-term security and functionality under a ported XFree86 or X.Org environment.


## Licensing

If the newer versions compile, great, and hopefully they are under a GNU GPL license. If they do not compile properly with KDE1/StuDE, then we may need to approach the author to ask him to re-license it under the GNU GPL or a compatible license.
