# StuDE
StuDE - Desktop Environment Fork of KDE1 - Lightweight, Fast, Independent, Simple and Stupid.

!! This is obsolete and unmaintained software. DO NOT USE on a production system. !!

As far as I know the KDE components are all licensed under the GNU GPL version 2. Any licensing discrepancies, please let me know.

Open source gives us the freedom to do something different. For both nostalgic reasons as well as others, the plan is to update KDE1 and port it to a newer version of Qt, due to licensing issues with Qt. While possible, porting to a different library is unlikely as newer versions of Qt are open source and widely used, and probably perform just as well if not better than maintaing Qt version 1. Hence, Qt version 1 is NOT available here, even though it was distributed with the original KDE1 source tarball. It can be obtained from the KDE project here on GitHub if you so desire.

Update: Qt2 has been made part of ZFreeKit. StuDE will be ported to use ZFreeKit.

This project is not an attempt to fork from KDE because KDE is poor - but rather to provide an alternative, experimenting in utilizing vastly simplified software, among other reasons. The theory is that older software was written simpler because there were less resources available. While there is a significant amount of work to enable such old software to function in a modern environment, it will still be significantly leaner when running. Plus it's just a bit nostalgic to run such old software. (Yes - KDE1 *can* be run on Debian 8).

Update 01-11-2017 - Yes it IS possible to run KDE1 on a modern system. I have it currently running on a Debian 8 system. It's far from fully functional, as many components are not currently working. However the base part DOES run and is stable. Contact me for proof or binaries if you so wish. I will be committing a bunch of the working code shortly. Again, as noted previously, Qt1 (currently REQUIRED to run KDE1), is NOT available here. You can get it from the KDE project's Git repository.
